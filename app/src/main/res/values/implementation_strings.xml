    <string name="applock_accessibility_service_description">If you use MaxLock\'s no Xposed implementation, this accessibility service will be used
        to detect app changes. No data can or will be collected from your screen content in any situation.\n
        Although this service doesn\'t provide any accessibility features, it is strongly needed for the core feature of the app to work,
        if you don\'t use the default Xposed implementation.\n
        \n
        Permissions:
        - Observe your actions: This permission is requested by default for all accessibility services, and isn\'t directly needed by MaxLock.

    <string name="accessibility_alert"><i>Since the no-root version uses an accessibility service, it works on every device without system modifications,
        but it also consumes more battery and is less secure.\nIt\'s therefore highly recommended to use the default implementation if you have
        the possibility to root your device or are already rooted!</i></string>
