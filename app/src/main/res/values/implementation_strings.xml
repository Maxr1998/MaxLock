    <string name="implementation_alert"><i>Since the no-Xposed version uses an accessibility service, it works on every device without system modifications,
        but also consumes a lot more RAM (system memory) and battery.\nIt\'s therefore highly recommended to use the default implementation if you have
        the possibility to install Xposed or already have it installed!</i></string>
    <string name="xposed_inactive_warning">MaxLock could not hook the Android System methods needed for it to work. This may have several reasons:\n
    &#x2022; <i>Xposed Framework is not installed</i>\n
    &#x2022; <i>Xposed is installed and active, but you didn\'t enable MaxLock in Xposed installer (\"Modules\" tab) or didn\'t reboot afterwards.</i>\n
    &#x2022; <i>Xposed Framework got disabled by Xposed safemode. Look at the Xposed Thread on XDA for further information.</i>\n
    &#x2022; <i>MaxLock may have encountered a crash. You should send me a bugreport from the bottom of this screen then.</i></string>
    <string name="accessibility_inactive_warning">Accessibility service is not enabled. Tap here to enable in settings, without it, app locking won\'t work!</string>
