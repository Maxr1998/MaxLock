    <string name="applock_accessibility_service_description">If you use MaxLock\'s no Xposed implementation, this accessibility service will be used
        to detect app changes. No data can or will be collected from your screen content in any situation.\n
        Although this service doesn\'t provide any accessibility features, it is strongly needed for the core feature of the app to work,
        if you don't use the default Xposed implementation.\n

        Permissions:
        - Observe your actions: This permission is requested by default for all accessibility services, and isn't directly needed by MaxLock.

    <string name="xposed_success_information">Xposed installed &amp; active, awesome!</string>
    <string name="implementation_alert"><i>Since the no-Xposed version uses an accessibility service, it works on every device without system modifications,
        but also consumes a lot more RAM (system memory) and battery.\nIt\'s therefore highly recommended to use the default implementation if you have
        the possibility to install Xposed or already have it installed!</i></string>
    <string name="xposed_inactive_warning">MaxLock could not hook the Android System methods needed for it to work. This may have several reasons:\n
    &#x2022; <i>Xposed Framework is not installed</i>\n
    &#x2022; <i>Xposed is installed and active, but you didn\'t enable MaxLock in Xposed installer (\"Modules\" tab) or didn\'t reboot afterwards.</i>\n
    &#x2022; <i>Xposed Framework got disabled by Xposed safemode. Look at the Xposed Thread on XDA for further information.</i>\n
    &#x2022; <i>MaxLock may have encountered a crash. You should send me a bug report from the bottom of this screen then.</i></string>
